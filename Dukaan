// A code to solve problem : Wastage of many expensive Products due to their expiry dates. Many times a "Dukaandar" forgot to sell products before their expiry due to
// which it result into lost of many essential items and a lot of money. This Programme take the age of product at the time it has bought or manufacture by "Dukaandar"
// which takes a little time of his/her but consistently collect all the information and start a ALERT message for those products whose expiry are 6 months near 
// so that a "Dukaandar" can sell it before it's Deadline and can save a lot of money.

// NOTE : It is a starting project Idea it can be prepare by using Web Development and by making software or it can be add in the previous software.Also we can ON daliy ALERT Notifications
// By this it become a very useful and essential software in this technical world and can save and make a lot of money through this because "Saving money is making money".

// let's start coding in c++ !!
